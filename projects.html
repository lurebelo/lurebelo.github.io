                                <li>ASTRA - Advanced Space Technologies and Research Alliance - aims at investigating and developing innovative software architectures for new space applications. The idea goes towards a framework that hosts accelerators for artificial intelligence, capable of autonomy on board. This technology should allow maneuvers, reconfigurations, and on-board diagnostics-based artificial intelligence, as well as update of software when the satellite is in orbit. </li>

                                <li>Software testing has become an important asset to qualify software, in particular, critical software, such as those of space applications. Once the software is modeled as a Finite State Machine (FSM), it is possible to apply criteria or methods to generate test cases or test sequences. However, depending on the criteria, a large number of software test cases are generated and it may not be possible to exercise all the test cases. This project has the objective of investigating the use of the steady-state probabilities, obtained by means of solving a Markov chain (modeled as a FSM), in order to rank the test cases and it is up to the test manager to exercise as many test cases as possible based on the available budget and time constraints.

                                <li>The project foresees an open and collaborative platform for Historians on the web, a historical digital cartographic base of the city of São Paulo, referring to the period of its urban-industrial modernization (1870-1940). It offers an interface that allows interactivity of interested researchers, so that they can feed the available database with spatializable events from their own investigations. This way, interested researchers will be able to produce maps and visualizations of their respective research. This actual phase aims to expand the spatial coverage, the platform's functionalities, the engagement of the target community and the conditions for replicating the project to other cities. </li>
