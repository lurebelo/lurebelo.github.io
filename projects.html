                                <li>ASTRA - Advanced Space Technologies and Research Alliance - aims at investigating and developing innovative software architectures for new space applications. The idea goes towards a framework that hosts accelerators for artificial intelligence, capable of autonomy on board. This technology should allow maneuvers, reconfigurations, and on-board diagnostics-based artificial intelligence, as well as update of software when the satellite is in orbit.

                                <li>Littering is a major problem that threatens the environment (e.g., causing fire hazards, air pollution and street flooding), the society (e.g., causing human health hazards), and the economy (e.g., causing significant expenses for administrations and municipalities). The root of littering is indeed in the society and cannot be feasibly solved by the authorities alone: addressing littering requires everyones’ commitment. Managing littering is a multi-facet problem that requires the cooperation of different professionalisms and agencies. The project focuses on illegal dumping and addresses the automated localization and identification of abandoned littering and of managing its proper disposal in an integrated, and flexible way.

                                <li>Software testing has become an important asset to qualify software, in particular, critical software, such as those of space applications. Once the software is modeled as a Finite State Machine (FSM), it is possible to apply criteria or methods to generate test cases or test sequences. However, depending on the criteria, a large number of software test cases are generated and it may not be possible to exercise all the test cases. This project has the objective of investigating the use of the steady-state probabilities, obtained by means of solving a Markov chain (modeled as a FSM), in order to rank the test cases and it is up to the test manager to exercise as many test cases as possible based on the available budget and time constraints.

                                <li>The project foresees an open and collaborative platform for Historians on the web, a historical digital cartographic base of the city of São Paulo, referring to the period of its urban-industrial modernization (1870-1940). It offers an interface that allows interactivity of interested researchers, so that they can feed the available database with spatializable events from their own investigations. This way, interested researchers will be able to produce maps and visualizations of their respective research. This actual phase aims to expand the spatial coverage, the platform's functionalities, the engagement of the target community and the conditions for replicating the project to other cities.

                                <li>Within the context of Blockchains, Smart Contracts are codes to ensure agreement among the parties. The main essence of Blockchain concept is that such codes are unchangeable. This means, if the code has some flaw, there is no option to fix it. Therefore, this leads to the importance and validation (tests) and verification (correctness) of such codes besides looking into code vulnerabilities (security). The project will develop a Systematic Mapping (SM) to understand what the available methods and/or tools are to validate, verify and ensure removing vulnerabilities. The second step, based on the results of the SM, is to adopt or develop a method/tool for the proposed purpose. More details available in our publication:</li>

                                <li>Spinal pain is one of the biggest problems today. In a study published in 2015 by collaborators of the Global Burden of Disease Study, in Brazil, low back pain is ranked first among the disorders that cause the most years of life lost and disability. Neck pain is ranked fourth. The project is divided into two phases: initially, the aim is to analyze databases from a physiotherapy clinic existing since 2008 with 2000 patients. The idea is to carry out pre-processing and make the data ready for Artificial Intelligence algorithms to be applied. The second phase aims to characterize the evolution of patients with spinal pain undergoing physiotherapeutic treatment based on scientific evidence, in addition to outlining their profile, which makes it possible to develop a more efficient action plan.

                                <li>In order to ensure that the software developed is of high quality, testing and formal verification activities must be carried out. However, the practical feasibility of carrying out these activities depends on development methods that explore the joint use of techniques, as well as tools that help them to be carried out, since the execution of both usually constitutes a high cost for software development. In view of the need to facilitate testing and formal verification of mission-critical software systems, this project proposes to develop an integrated methodology, with the support of computational tools, for the formal verification and testing of these systems, taking into account reducing the costs of Verification and Validation activities. The main objects of study that constitute a scientific challenge to the project are the exploration of the complementarity of the two activities across the development of critical systems, to enable the joint use of these activities and evaluate the cost of their application. The case studies, which will be used in this project, are based on space software developed in projects at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE).

                                <li>This proposal gives public school students the opportunity to improve their knowledge of Mathematics content, which is usually required in the country's main university entrance exams and the National High School Exam (ENEM). Given the reality found in public schools, where the Mathematics course is often not taught by a specialist in the area, this project complements the students' training, allowing closer contact with a Mathematics teacher who can clarify doubts and assist in guiding studies. To this end, it is proposed the development of a web platform for studies, called IFVest, which will have a database of exam questions, in addition to generating simulations and making content summaries for exam avaliations.

                                <li>This project aims to automate the control of school meals for the network of municipal schools in the city of Jacareí, together with the Municipal Department of Education. Currently, the management of this data is done manually, using printed sheets and spreadsheets, which requires a considerable amount of time and work. With the implementation of the tool, greater agility and less rework are expected.

                                <li>At the moment, the survey to monitor students leaving the campus is carried out through a questionnaire, available on the institution's website, where information is collected manually, after the students' responses. The aim is to create a web system that allows the management of information provided by students about their current situation, to evaluate the courses, as well as understand the graduate's insertion in society. Furthermore, it is expected that the system can integrate students, providing meetings and providing job opportunities, in addition to encouraging the maintenance of links with the institution, attending internal campus events.</li>
