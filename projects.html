                                <li>ASTRA - Advanced Space Technologies and Research Alliance - aims at investigating and developing innovative software architectures for new space applications. The idea goes towards a framework that hosts accelerators for artificial intelligence, capable of autonomy on board. This technology should allow maneuvers, reconfigurations, and on-board diagnostics-based artificial intelligence, as well as update of software when the satellite is in orbit.

                                <li>Software testing has become an important asset to qualify software, in particular, critical software, such as those of space applications. Once the software is modeled as a Finite State Machine (FSM), it is possible to apply criteria or methods to generate test cases or test sequences. However, depending on the criteria, a large number of software test cases are generated and it may not be possible to exercise all the test cases. This project has the objective of investigating the use of the steady-state probabilities, obtained by means of solving a Markov chain (modeled as a FSM), in order to rank the test cases and it is up to the test manager to exercise as many test cases as possible based on the available budget and time constraints.

                                <li>The project foresees an open and collaborative platform for Historians on the web, a historical digital cartographic base of the city of São Paulo, referring to the period of its urban-industrial modernization (1870-1940). It offers an interface that allows interactivity of interested researchers, so that they can feed the available database with spatializable events from their own investigations. This way, interested researchers will be able to produce maps and visualizations of their respective research. This actual phase aims to expand the spatial coverage, the platform's functionalities, the engagement of the target community and the conditions for replicating the project to other cities.

                                <li>Within the context of Blockchains, Smart Contracts are codes to ensure agreement among the parties. The main essence of Blockchain concept is that such codes are unchangeable. This means, if the code has some flaw, there is no option to fix it. Therefore, this leads to the importance and validation (tests) and verification (correctness) of such codes besides looking into code vulnerabilities (security). The project will develop a Systematic Mapping (SM) to understand what the available methods and/or tools are to validate, verify and ensure removing vulnerabilities. The second step, based on the results of the SM, is to adopt or develop a method/tool for the proposed purpose. More details available in our publication:</li>

                                <li>Spinal pain is one of the biggest problems today. In a study published in 2015 by collaborators of the Global Burden of Disease Study, in Brazil, low back pain is ranked first among the disorders that cause the most years of life lost and disability. Neck pain is ranked fourth. The project is divided into two phases: initially, the aim is to analyze databases from a physiotherapy clinic existing since 2008 with 2000 patients. The idea is to carry out pre-processing and make the data ready for Artificial Intelligence algorithms to be applied. The second phase aims to characterize the evolution of patients with spinal pain undergoing physiotherapeutic treatment based on scientific evidence, in addition to outlining their profile, which makes it possible to develop a more efficient action plan.
