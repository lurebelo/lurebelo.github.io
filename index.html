                        As of today, I hold a postdoctoral position at the Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI), Italy, from 2022. My research focuses on techniques to enhance software quality, particularly through testing, empirical software engineering, software architecture, and formal methods. At GSSI, I have been deeply involved in the VITALITY project in collaboration with Thales Alenia Space, where we proposed reference architectures for autonomous satellite software integrating AI and DevOps. I have also contributed to the COBOL project, developing adaptive solutions for smart environmental management using digital twins. Another active line of research explores software test prioritization using Markov chains, which addresses the practical challenges of testing in critical domains, where I have a strong background. Alongside my research, in the last years I have been actively involved in organizing international events, as well as serving as a reviewer of top conferences and journals.

                        As a former Assistant Professor at the Federal Institute of São Paulo (IFSP) (2014 to 2022), I taught a broad range of undergraduate and technical courses and led community-centred projects in health informatics, assistive technologies, and education. I supervised over 20 undergraduate theses and outreach projects (fellows), several of which resulted in tools, which serve the community directly. These experiences inform my student-centred approach to teaching, where theory is integrated with real-world applications. Additionally, I have been the coordinator of the Undergraduate Program of Systems Analysis and Development and of the Secondary Technical Program of Web Development. This period includes a sort of pedagogical activities, such as creation of curriculum, approval of regulations for internship and undergraduate thesis, to name a few. Previously, I have been a Lecturer at the São Paulo Faculty of Technology (FATEC) (2013 to 2014), teaching courses and coordinating the final undergraduate thesis.

                        My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Applied Computing from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE), a Master's in Electronic Engineering and Computing from the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA), and a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems from the Paulista State University (UNESP).

                    <p> 
                        I have also been collaborating with Graduate Programs. At GSSI, I offer courses for doctoral students. At INPE, as a collaborating Faculty, I’ve offered courses and co-supervised students. Some IFSP students under my supervision worked on research topics developed at INPE.

                    <p> 
                        I bring over a decade of combined teaching and research, and I am heavily committed to inclusive and impactful education and innovation.  Throughout my career, my research bridges foundational software engineering across various domains such as space systems, health, robotic, assistive technologies, and sustainable computing. I have published in high-impact journals, contributed to international research projects, and collaborated with both academic and industrial partners. My experience also spans graduate and undergraduate teaching, curriculum development, and supervision. And lastly, I am an enthusiast of programs aimed at encouraging the participation of women in technology.
