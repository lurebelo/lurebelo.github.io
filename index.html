                        I am currently attending a Post-doc position at GSSI - Gran Sasso Science Institute, localized in L'Aquila - Italy, collaborating with the Formal Methods and Software Engineering groups in the Computer Science Department.

                        Previously, I hold the position of Assistant Professor at Federal Institute for Education, Science and Technology of São Paulo, Jacareí campus and voluntary Collaborator in the Graduate Program in Applied Computing at INPE - National Institute for Space Research, both in Brazil.

                        I received my PhD in Applied Computing from INPE - National Institute for Space Research (2015), Master in Electronic Engineering and Computing from ITA - Technological Institute of Aeronautics (2009), and Bachelor of Information Systems from UNESP - Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho (2001).

                        My research interests involve studying techniques \ methods that maximize finding software systems defects, such as automatic generation of test cases (Model-Based Testing) and Formal Verification (model transformation and Inspection using Model Checking). I am also intended to work with Markov Chains to deal with Test case Prioritization and Performance issues. My areas of previous work include Software Engineering, Software Verification and Validation, Assistive Technology, and Machine Learning.
